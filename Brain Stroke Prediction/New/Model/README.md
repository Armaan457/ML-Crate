## **Brain Stroke Prediction** ##

## **Goal:** ##

To cleanse and analyse the data to understand the data and make the best performing Neural Network for the same.

## **Dataset:** ##

 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

## **What I Had Done:** ##
* Basic data exploration
* Cleaning the data and transforming it
* Data visualisation
* Making Neural Networks with Tensorflow by using various layers, activation functions and regularisers

## **Libraries Needed:** ##
pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn and tensorflow

## **Libraries Needed:** ##
Best performing model was model-5: 9 layers with both relu and linear activations and L2 regulariser which had 95.6% training accuracy and 95.3% test accuracy. All models had no overfitting or underfitting.
